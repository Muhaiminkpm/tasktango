## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE) for a calming and focused feel. This is a versatile color suitable for task management.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), almost the same hue as the primary but very desaturated, for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Light purple (#B19CD9) to draw attention to interactive elements. This is analogous to the primary, and provides good contrast through changes to brightness and saturation.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.  This pairing brings both a contemporary precision, and readability in longer text.
- Use clear and concise icons to represent task status and priority.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout to facilitate efficient task management.
- Incorporate subtle animations for task transitions and completion to enhance user experience.
